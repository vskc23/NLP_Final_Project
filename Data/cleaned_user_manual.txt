an established method for encouraging the adaptation of goods and services to the environment the main problem as far as computers and other electronics equipment are concerned is that environmentally harmful substances are used both in the products and during their manufacture since it is not so far possible to satisfactorily recycle the majority of electronics equipment most of these potentially damaging substances sooner or later enter nature there are also other characteristics of a computer such as energy consumption levels that are important from the viewpoints of both the work internal
